# Security Policy

We take the security of VServer SSH Stats seriously. Please follow the guidance below when reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions
We release security fixes for the most recent tagged version of the integration. Older versions distributed via HACS or manual downloads should be upgraded to the latest release to receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security problems.
- Report vulnerabilities privately via the GitHub Security Advisory form: <https://github.com/404GamerNotFound/vserver-ssh-stats/security/advisories/new>.
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce, the affected Home Assistant version, integration version, and any relevant logs or configuration snippets.
- Encrypt sensitive attachments if possible, or request an alternative secure communication channel through the advisory form.

We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and work with you to triage and remediate the issue. Credit will be given in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
